                        <h3>ABSTRACT : </h3>
                        <div class="oh">
                            <p>A brain tumor is one of the deadliest illnesses which occurs due to the sudden and unregulated brain tissue growth inside the skull. Detection and Classification of a brain tumor is an important step to better understanding its mechanism. However, it is a time taking process and requires expertise to test the MRI images, manually. Nowadays, the advancement of Computer-assisted Diagnosis (CAD), machine learning, and deep learning in specific allow the radiologist to more reliably identify brain tumors. The CAD process has improved dramatically using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications in the medical imaging field.
                            CNN presents a segmentation-free method that eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature extractor techniques. For this reason, different CNN architectures have been proposed by several researchers. Most of the CNN models reported multiclass brain tumor detection, including a vast number of image data. Theproposed CNN-based approach not only aims to reduce the time required for diagnosis but also enhances
                            the precision of tumor localization and characterization. This research introduces two deep learning models for identifying brain abnormalities as well as classifying different tumor grades, including meningioma, glioma, and pituitary.
